# Pathfinding algorithm visualizer

This is a small side project with which I have familiarized myself with the following skills:
  - A* algorithm
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - TypeScript
  - CSS Animations

# How to use

It is rather simple.
  - Navigate to https://bicip.github.io,
  - move the start or the end node by dragging it to another node,
  - create walls by clicking or dragging across empty nodes,
  - create weighted nodes by pressing a number between 1 and 9 while hovering over an empty node.

When you're done just press start and let the magic begin.\

At the bottom of the screen there will be some algorithm information.\
Time to complete will tell you how much time (in ms) the algorithm needed to find the end node (or not).\
Path length will tell you how long the path is. When there are weighted nodes, their weight will also be used to calculate the path length.\
